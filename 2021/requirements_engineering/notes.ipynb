   "source": [
    "* **Ask questions:** Ask lots of questions. Ask more questions. If you think that you have asked enough questions... Go ask more questions.\n",
    "* **Understand your stakeholder(s):** Your stakeholders may use language differently to you, so make sure that you both mean the same thing. You should also make a clear distinction their \"needs\" and their \"wants\", and be clear about what problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "* **Have a plan:** It can be tempting to just jump straight into a project, but spending some time on planning how you are going to approach a problem and how long you plan to spend developing different components makes a huge difference.\n",
    "* **Be realistic:** Remember that we need to work within our constraints, whether they be budget, time, skills or technologies.\n",
    "* **Break things down into smaller chunks:** You will typically start off with one big problem that you want to solve, and this may seem intimidating. The first step that you should take is to break this down into smaller sub-problems. And then break these down intro smaller sub-problems. Continue this process until you feel that you are dealing with problems that you know how to solve. This is the essence of software development..\n",
    "* **Comment and document your work:** Very rarely will you work on a project in isolation. It is, therefore, very important that you make notes and/or comment on what you are doing. Not only will your colleagues benefit from this, but you will too (we're all liable to forget our own work pretty quickly so some well-placed comments can act as great reminders of what you were thinking last time you were working on a project).\n",
